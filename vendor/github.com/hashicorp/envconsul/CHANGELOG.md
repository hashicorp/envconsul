## envconsul CHANGELOG

## v0.7.3 (UNRELEASED)

SECURITY:

  * Fixed an issue where the parent's environment could get supplied to the child
    process if `envconsul` is given an empty prefix, even when using `-pristine`
    [GH-159]

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Compile using Go 1.9.2 [GH-158]

BUG FIXES:

  * Fixed Makefile to use Go version from the environment [GH-157]

## v0.7.2 (August 25, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Compile using Go 1.9.0

## v0.7.1 (August 7, 2017)

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove dynamic linking due to a missing underscore in CGO_ENABLED during
      compilation [GH-147]

## v0.7.0 (August 1, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * `kill_signal` (configuration) and `-kill-signal` (CLI) now refer to the
    signal that _Envconsul_ should listen to for termination, _not_ the signal
    that Envconsul should send to the child process. Use `exec.kill_signal` or
    `-exec-kill-signal` to specify the command to send to the child process.

DEPRECATIONS:

  * (configuration) `consul` is now `consul { address = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `auth` is now `consul { auth { ... } }`.
  * (configuration) `path` is deprecated and there is no configuration file
    replacement. Use the CLI option instead.
  * (configuration) `splay = "..."` is now `exec { splay = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `retry = "..."` is now separately controlled via both the
    `consul` and `vault` stanzas to allow for additional configuration.
  * (configuration) `ssl {}` is now separately controlled via both the
    `consul` and `vault` stanzas to allow for additional configuration.
  * (configuration) `timeout = "..."` is now `exec { kill_timeout = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `token = "..."` is now `consul { token = "..." }`.

  * (cli) `-auth` is now `-consul-auth`.
  * (cli) `-addr` is now `-consul-addr`.
  * (cli) `-splay` is now `-exec-splay`.
  * (cli) `-retry` is now `-consul-retry-*` and `-vault-retry-*`.
  * (cli) `-ssl-*` is now `-consul-ssl-*` and `-vault-ssl-*`.
  * (cli) `-timeout` is now `-exec-kill-timeout`.
  * (cli) `-token` is now `-consul-token`.

## v0.6.2 (Jan 13, 2017)

  * Ensure returned value is not nil [GH-124]

## v0.6.1 (June 9, 2016)

  * Load `VAULT_TOKEN` from the environment into the config [GH-99, GH-100]

    [GH-41]
  * Update to new Consul Template APIs which are more efficient
  * Match Makefile and semantics for other HashiCorp projects
  * Set a default max-stale value of 1s
  * Support reloading configuration on SIGHUP (but the signal will also be

  * Add support for logging to syslog
  * Add `log_level` as a configuration file option and CLI option
  * Add support for basic HTTP authentication when connecting to Consul
  * Add support for connecting to Consul via SSL

    if they are less than the maximum stale value (GH-36)

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove deprecated CLI and config options

## v0.3.0 (November 4, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Watch and reload by default - previously you needed to specify the `-reload`
  flag for envconsul to poll, but this is now the default behavior - you can
  restore the old behavior using the new `-once` flag
  * Leverage watching libraries from Consul Template
  * Unified command interface with Consul Template
  * Added support for quiescene using the new `-wait` option
  * Added support for Consul ACLs using the new `-token` option
  * Added support for reading configuration from file using the new `-config`
  option - the config file is HCL

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * Added `-timeout` parameter for specifying the interval to wait for SIGTERM
  to return before sending SIGKILL
  * Added `-version` flag to print the current version of envconsul
  * Added a full debug log tracer which can be set using `ENV_CONSUL_LOG=debug`
  * Drastically improved documentation with usage examples and feature
  documentation

  thoroughly tested)

DEPRECATIONS:

  * `-addr` is deprecated in favor of `-consul` and will be removed in the next
  major release
  * `-dc` is deprecated in favor of using the inline `@dc` syntax and will be
  removed in the next major release

  `-once`. envconsul now intelligently exits where appropriate

  * Sanitize and upcase by default
  * If `-reload` is not set, don't watch keys
