# Telemetry

The Vault agent collects various runtime metrics about the performance of
different libraries and subsystems. These metrics are aggregated on a ten
second interval and are retained for one minute.

To view this data, you must send a signal to the Vault process: on Unix,
this is `USR1` while on Windows it is `BREAK`. Once Vault receives the signal,
it will dump the current telemetry information to the agent's `stderr`.

This telemetry information can be used for debugging or otherwise
getting a better view of what Vault is doing.

Telemetry information can be streamed to both [statsite](https://github.com/armon/statsite)
as well as statsd based on providing the appropriate configuration options.

Below is sample output of a telemetry dump:
