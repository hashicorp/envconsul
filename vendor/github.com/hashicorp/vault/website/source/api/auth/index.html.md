# Authentication Backends

Each authentication backend publishes its own set of API paths and methods. 
These endpoints are documented in this section. Authentication backends are
mount at a path, but the documentation will assume the default mount points for 
simplicity.  If you are mounting at a different path, you should adjust your API
calls accordingly.

For the API documentation for a specific authentication backend, please choose a
authentication backend from the navigation.
