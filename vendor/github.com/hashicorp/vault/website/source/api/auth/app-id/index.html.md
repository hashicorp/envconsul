# App ID Auth Backend HTTP API (DEPRECATED)

This is the API documentation for the Vault App ID authentication backend. For
general information about the usage and operation of the App ID backend, please
see the [Vault App ID backend documentation](/docs/auth/app-id.html).

This documentation assumes the App ID backend is mounted at the `/auth/app-id`
path in Vault. Since it is possible to mount auth backends at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.
