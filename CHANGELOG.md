      compilation [GH-147]

## v0.7.0 (August 1, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES:

  * `kill_signal` (configuration) and `-kill-signal` (CLI) now refer to the
    signal that _Envconsul_ should listen to for termination, _not_ the signal
    that Envconsul should send to the child process. Use `exec.kill_signal` or
    `-exec-kill-signal` to specify the command to send to the child process.

DEPRECATIONS:

  * (configuration) `consul` is now `consul { address = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `auth` is now `consul { auth { ... } }`.
  * (configuration) `path` is deprecated and there is no configuration file
    replacement. Use the CLI option instead.
  * (configuration) `splay = "..."` is now `exec { splay = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `retry = "..."` is now separately controlled via both the
    `consul` and `vault` stanzas to allow for additional configuration.
  * (configuration) `ssl {}` is now separately controlled via both the
    `consul` and `vault` stanzas to allow for additional configuration.
  * (configuration) `timeout = "..."` is now `exec { kill_timeout = "..." }`.
  * (configuration) `token = "..."` is now `consul { token = "..." }`.

  * (cli) `-auth` is now `-consul-auth`.
  * (cli) `-addr` is now `-consul-addr`.
  * (cli) `-splay` is now `-exec-splay`.
  * (cli) `-retry` is now `-consul-retry-*` and `-vault-retry-*`.
  * (cli) `-ssl-*` is now `-consul-ssl-*` and `-vault-ssl-*`.
  * (cli) `-timeout` is now `-exec-kill-timeout`.
  * (cli) `-token` is now `-consul-token`.

BUG FIXES:

  * Remove deprecated CLI and config options

## v0.3.0 (November 4, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * Watch and reload by default - previously you needed to specify the `-reload`
  flag for envconsul to poll, but this is now the default behavior - you can
  restore the old behavior using the new `-once` flag

  * Unified command interface with Consul Template
  * Added support for quiescene using the new `-wait` option
